# TOP SECRETS

### Learning Objectives

- Use Express middleware to ensure requests are authenticated
- Use cookies to store user data
- Use JWTs for storing user data in cookies
- Sign & verify JWTs to ensure validitity

### Description

You've been hired by the Department of Defense to build a new service for their intranet: an API for storing top secret, confidential information. Your first task is to build an API and database schema for storing user emails & (hashed) passwords, as well as endpoints for creating and listing notes that can only be accessed by authenticated users. No UI is required; everything can be done via an API.

#### `Secret` Model:

|         field | type                                                                                          |
| ------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          `id` | bigint (generated)                                                                            |
|       `title` | text (required)                                                                               |
| `description` | text (required)                                                                               |
|  `created_at` | timestamp ([autogenerated](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-current_timestamp/)) |

### Acceptance Criteria

Approach this deliverable *vertically*, meaning that you should write a test and any model/controller methods for a single route (i.e. **not** writing all the tests, then all the models, then all the controllers). **Your git commit history needs to show a vertical approach**.

- Git history shows a vertical approach
- Users can register using email & password
- Users can log in using email & password
- Passwords are hashed when stored in the database
- User information is stored in a cookie when signed in
- Cookie contains a signed JWT of the user record
  - The `User` model instance should be an object with an `id` & `email`, but _**without the password hash!**_
- Logged in users can view top secrets by visiting `/api/v1/secrets`
- Logged in users can create new secrets by `POST`ing to `/api/v1/secrets`
- STRETCH: Only allow user sign ups if their email ends with `@defense.gov`
- STRETCH: `User` model stores the user's first and last name as well
